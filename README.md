## Screenshots
(Add screenshots here later — e.g., main window, pop-ups, summary grid)

## Development Notes
- Data stored in `~/EstradaFamilyBudget/budget.json`
- Balances and upcoming payments are hardcoded defaults — update in `App.java` as needed
- Future ideas:
  - Dynamic real-time temperature (OpenWeather API for Salado, TX)
  - Persistent "paid" checkbox status for bills
  - Functional "Add New Bill" / "Add New Income" dialogs
  - CSV/PDF export
  - Charts (pie for category spending, bar for trends)
  - Dark mode toggle
